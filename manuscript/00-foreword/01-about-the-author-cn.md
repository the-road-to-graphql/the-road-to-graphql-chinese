> I am a German software and web engineer dedicated to learning and teaching programming in JavaScript. After obtaining my Master's Degree in computer science, I continued learning on my own. I gained experience from the startup world, where I used JavaScript intensively during both my professional life and spare time, which eventually led to a desire to teach others about these topics.

我是一个致力于学习和讲授 JavaScript 编程的德国软件和 Web 工程师。在我拿到计算机科学硕士学位后，我仍然坚持学习。我从初创团队中收获了许多经验，期间无论是上班时还是工作之余我都大量的使用了 JavaScript，最终这样的经验导致我想要去教授他人学习与之相关的话题。

> For a few years, I worked closely with an exceptional team of engineers at a company called Small Improvements, developing large scale applications. The company offered a SaaS product that enables customers to give feedback to businesses. This application was developed using JavaScript on its frontend, and Java as its backend. The first iteration of Small Improvements' frontend was written in Java with the Wicket Framework and jQuery. When the first generation of SPAs became popular, the company migrated to Angular 1.x for its frontend application. After using Angular for over two years, it became clear that Angular wasn't the best solution to work with state intense applications, so they made the jump to React and Redux. This enabled it to operate on a large scale successfully.

前几年中，我与一家名为 Small Improvements 的公司的优秀工程师团队密切合作，开发大规模应用程序。这家公司提供一个 SaaS 产品，使消费者能够向企业提供反馈。这个应用前端使用了 JavaScript 后端使用了 Java。在首个迭代中，Small Improve 的前端是用 Java 的 Wicket 框架和 jQuery 写的。当第一代单页面应用（Single Page Application, SPA）变得流行时，公司将前端应用迁移到了 Angular 1.x。在使用了 Angular 超过两年后，公司意识到 Angular 对于状态密集型应用来说并不是最好的解决方案，所以他们就跳到了 React 和 Redux。这使得他们的应用能够成功地大规模运行。

> During my time in the company, I regularly wrote articles about web development on my website. I received great feedback from people learning from my articles which allowed me to improve my writing and teaching style. Article after article, I grew my ability to teach others. I felt that my first articles were packed with too much information, quite overwhelming for students, but I improved by focusing on one subject at a time.

我在这家公司的期间，我定期的在我的个人网站上写关于 web 开发的文章。我收到了许多来自读者的宝贵反馈，这些反馈使我的写作和教学风格得到了提高。日积月累，我掌握了教授别人的能力。我感觉我的第一篇文章涵盖了太多的信息，这对于学生来说过犹不及，后来我通过一次只专注于一个主题来改善这个问题。

> Currently, I am a self-employed software engineer and educator. I find it a fulfilling pastime to see students thrive by giving them clear objectives and short feedback loops.

现在，我是一个自由软件工程师和教育工作者。我发现当看到学生从我给与的明确目标和快速循环反馈中茁壮成长时，我着实感到欣慰。你也可以在我的[个人网站](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about)上找到更多关于我的信息以及如何支持我或与我共事。
