## 如何使用本书

> No one has ever learned programming from reading a book. Programming is about practical experiences, and conquering challenges to strengthen your skills as a developer long-term. Paradigms like functional programming and object-oriented programming require more extensive practice to use practically. Complex concepts like state management in modern web applications and libraries like React and Express will take more than a weekend to master. You will only learn these concepts by practicing them consistently.

没有人是能通过读一本书就学会编程的。因为编程是一门需要动手练习的学问，作为一个开发者，你需要不断的克服挑战来提高你的技能。此外，要想熟练的使用像函数式编程和面向对象这样的编程范式，更需要大量的实战经验；要想掌握现代 web 应用中如状态管理这样复杂的概念，亦或者像 React 和 Express 这样的框架，也要花大量的时间。所以你只有通过不断地实战演练才能真正地理解这些概念。

> I want this book to provide you with more hands on experience and challenges to help you grow as a programmer. The challenges are meant to create a flow experience, a scenario where challenges are met by your skills and tools. If the book manages to keep the balance of challenging you and respecting your skill level, you might experience a [state of flow](https://www.robinwieruch.de/lessons-learned-deep-work-flow/). I found this insight astonishing when I read about it myself, so I hope I can induce it in this book.

我希望这本书能够为你提供更多的实战经验和挑战来帮助你成为一名程序员。这些挑战旨在创造一个循序渐进的学习体验，每个挑战都契合你当前的学习进度。如果本书能够将挑战与你的技能水平控制在一个良好的平衡点上，那么你的学习体验应该是一个[循序渐进](https://www.robinwieruch.de/lessons-learned-deep-work-flow/)的过程。我是从《Deep Work》这本书中了解到的这种方式，当我阅读那它时，它的洞察令我赞叹，所以我希望把这种循序渐进的学习方式引进到这本书当中。

> ### Tips & Tricks

### 提示 & 技巧

> As mentioned, there are practical tasks in the book, where you will be guided to solve problems using the techniques you learned in previous sections. It should let you experience practical uses for the lessons you've learned in these chapters, and provide deeper understanding of the more abstract content for your own projects.

正如前文提到的，本书有很多实战任务，这些任务引导你用学过的知识去解决问题。让你知道如何将理论知识运用在实战当中，这样可以加深你对抽象知识的理解，以便之后更好的运用在你自己的项目当中。

> Make sure to internalize each lesson before you continue with the next sections. The book is written in a way that the lessons build on the one before. Your knowledge of these topics scales horizontally using different techniques side-by-side, and vertically using technique-on-technique. Internalizing becomes much easier if you take notes as you move through the lessons. Consider writing down questions that aren't covered in the text so you can look them up afterward. These notes can also become feedback, which I use to improve future versions.

本书所有章节的内容都是基于之前章节的，所以在继续学习下一节内容之前确保自己已经消化了当前的内容。单独使用不同的知识点将提深你知识的广度，将不同的知识点结合在一起将提深你知识的深度。此外，记笔记也将有助于你消化课程的内容。在课程中记录下你的问题以便之后寻找答案。这些笔记也可能成为对本书的反馈，帮助我在之后的版本中提升课程质量。

> I encourage you to write the code examples out yourself instead of copy/pasting it. Typing out code teaches you how to find syntax errors and bugs, so you can fix errors on your own after you've moved on to trying the examples with your own data. Don't get discouraged if you encounter bugs, though. Bugs will usually appear in any application that gets complex enough, but it's acceptable to find them in learning scenarios because you'll have a chance to learn how to fix them.

我建议你自己敲样例代码而不是粘贴复制。敲代码有助于你找到语法错误和 bug，这样当用自定义数据跑样例代码时，你就能自己去修复出现的错误了。即使你遇到了 bug ，也不要灰心，通常情况下任何应用在变得复杂时都会出现 bug。而且在学习过程中，出现 bug 也是可以接受的，这样我们才有机会去学习如何修复它们。

> The materials that follow should be absorbed with an IDE open to type out the examples and observe the output. I will provide additional tools like [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) that show how the code examples would function in real-world situations. Try to find time between the lessons to experiment with your own applications and apply the tools you've acquired. Without applying what you've learned in these chapters, you can never master them. If you are having difficulty coming up with project ideas, this [article](https://www.robinwieruch.de/how-to-learn-framework/) could help.

对于材料的吸收学习，你需要用一个 IDE 打开它，然后键入样例代码并观察它的输出。我提供了一些额外的工具例如 [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground)，它可以展示样例代码如何在真实环境下运作。课程之余，你应该找时间将学到的工具和知识运用在你自己的项目上。若不学以致用，你将永远掌握不了它们。如果你还不知道自己该做一个什么项目，[这篇文章](https://www.robinwieruch.de/how-to-learn-framework/)可以帮助你找到它。
